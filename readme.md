For this javascript project I chose to recreate the classic windows game 'Minesweeper', using html, css and javascript. This is a quick puzzle game which many people have played, which requires the player to hunt for mines on a grid, while giving them limited information on where the bombs are located. Once the player clicks on the grid the squares are revealed, and they are shown how many potential bombs lie in the neighbouring squares. The player must use this information to deduce where the bombs are placed, and flag them accordingly. If all the bombs have been flagged then the player wins the game, however should the player click on a bomb, all the bombs explode and the game is over.

## Features
The game is quite minimal in design, with oonly a pop-up modal with which the player can interact and choose difficulty levels. On the initial load of the page this modal explains the rules for the game. These rules can be shown or hidden by clicking on the guide button, or while in game they can be accessed by clicking on the face at the top of the game board. The player also has three difficulty options, easy a 10 x 10 board with 10 bombs, medium a 12 x 12 board with 25 bombs, and hard a 15 x 15 board with 50 bombs. Once the player clicks a difficulty level, the modal closes, the timer starts and the game begins. The game may be paused again by clicking the face at the top of the game board. The player can left click on the board to reveal the squares, or right click on the board to place a flag on a square.

## Testing
The game has been tested on multiple browsers and devices, and appears to work flawlessly on desktop devices. On one of the mobile phones I did find a bug which changed the layout of the grid, but it was easily fixed by increasing the dpi settings on the phone. The game plays quite well on  mobile phones , onl requiring the user to long press on the board to place a flag.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
